put operation is always append. If the record (key) already exists, I cant
retrieve the block and modify, I just append with timestamp.

read op reads from block cache, and memstore because it has the latest writed data.

map() receives one tuple and retrieves 0 or memstore
the system shuffles & 
sorts the data and then passes it to reduce(), which takes a set of records and
returns one.
